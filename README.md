# Volumes and Fluids
This repo is for a volumetric ray marcher written in C++ with support for semi Lagrangian advection fluid simulation, sparse grids, and frustum shaped deep shadow maps.

Main featurs:
- Sparse and frustum shaped grids
- Constructive solid geometry of any implicit function
- Deep shadow map for lights
- Perlin noise fields (pyrocllastic displacement and Wisps)
- Signed distance fields from triangular meshes
- Semi Lagrangian fluid simulation with use defined forcing field
